It looks (from the file) numerical, and is presumably unique per hospital, although for the sake of the sample app I'm doing no validation checking for uniqueness. I could implement this using eg. class methods to check all instances of the class to determine if a given ID is already in use (in which case it's not unique), or better still a proper database storage mechanism eg. Core Data, which can specify unique constraints. I've never used Realm (it was in the job spec) but it looks like that has similar functionality
